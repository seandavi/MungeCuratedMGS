ANOVA	https://doi.org/10.1016/0169-7439(89)80095-4	Analysis of variance for detection of differences among group means in a sample
chi-square	https://doi.org/10.1080/14786440009463897	The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories

edgeR	https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616	Differential signal analysis of high-throughput count data based on the negative binomial distribution, including empirical Bayes estimation, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests
Fisher's Exact Test	http://www.biostathandbook.com/fishers.html	Fisher's exact test is used to determine if there are non-random associations between two categorical variables
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test	https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1951.10500769	Nonparametric test to compare the empirical distribution functions of two samples
Kruskall-Wallis	http://www.biostathandbook.com/kruskalwallis.html	The Kruskal–Wallis test by ranks, Kruskal–Wallis H test (named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis), or one-way ANOVA on ranks is a non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution. It is used for comparing two or more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes.

Logistic Regression	https://doi.org/10.1186/cc3045	Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary)
Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon)	https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.323.7309.391	Non-parametric alternative to the t-test when the data is severly non-normally distributed. Used to investigate whether two independent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution.

Random Forest Analysis	https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1010933404324	Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees
